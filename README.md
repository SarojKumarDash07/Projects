# Projects
This repository showcases various projects carried out using both Cadence tools and open-source platforms such as Ngspice and Xschem, all implemented with the SkyWater 130nm (SKY130) PDK.
## In-Memory Computing for Machine Learning Using 8T SRAM

## Differential Amplifier
- A differential amplifier is a type of electronic amplifier that amplifies the difference between two input signals while rejecting any voltage common to both inputs (called common-mode signals).
- Itâ€™s one of the most fundamental building blocks in analog and mixed-signal circuits.
### Advantages
- High CMRR
- Better stability
### Disadvantages
- Requires matched components for ideal operation.
- More complex biasing compared to single-ended amplifiers.
